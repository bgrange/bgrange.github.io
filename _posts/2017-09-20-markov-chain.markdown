**First Movement**

A prison of smiles.  
Thank you very much.  
For in the absence of my labor  
I have nothing to do but cock a grin.  
The aches and pains  
of lifting my cheeks  
Will wear me out.

Eventually.

Insurance has reimbursed  
my slow deterioration  
for too long,  
and the exegesis therein will dialectically materialize in a forthcoming novel  
by the author's daughter.

He who never sayeth much  
Sayeth little.  
And it's the little things that count.  

But can mice count?  
I wondered sitting in my rocking chair  
As I counted sheep,  
Trying to fall asleep.

Can sheep count?  
That would automate the process.  
Why do I need to count them?  
I am no shepherd.


**Second Movement**

"I see" said the blind man.  
And everyone laughed.  
Everyone in the world.  
This caused the blind man to start crying. Where did the tears come from?  

He still had functioning tear ducts  
Apparently.
