title:  "Markov Chain"
---

In math, a Markov Chain is a kind of "random walk" (a technical term). Imagine
you are exploring a new city. You don't want to rely on Google Maps because
that'd be boring, so here's what you do instead: at each street corner you
roll a die to choose which direction to go in. This is a sure way to get lost,
but sometimes that's what you want.

You can do the same thing with words. You start with one sentence. And at the
end of each sentence, you follow a random thought. And repeat.

Each sentence probably has a link to the previous one, but maybe there's no
larger logical structure. Imagine yourself as a frog hopping from lilly- pad
to lilly-pad, rather than a spider weaving a web.

Of course, you can do this exercise in speech or in writing. The best part is
when some genuine idea or feeling is expressed in the chaos.

Now, sit back, relax, and enjoy this example, which I call "Markov Chain" or
"A Prison of Smiles":

**First Movement**

A prison of smiles.  
Thank you very much.  
For in the absence of my labor  
I have nothing to do but cock a grin.  
The aches and pains  
of lifting my cheeks  
Will wear me out.

Eventually.

Insurance has reimbursed  
my slow deterioration  
for too long,  
and the exegesis therein will dialectically materialize in a forthcoming novel  
by the author's daughter.

He who never sayeth much  
Sayeth little.  
And it's the little things that count.  

But can mice count?  
I wondered sitting in my rocking chair  
As I counted sheep,  
Trying to fall asleep.

Can sheep count?  
That would automate the process.  
Why do I need to count them?  
I am no shepherd.


**Second Movement**

"I see" said the blind man.  
And everyone laughed.  
Everyone in the world.  
This caused the blind man to start crying. Where did the tears come from?  

He still had functioning tear ducts  
Apparently.

Computers have been trained to generate text in a similar way. You feed it a
set of "input text", (e.g. all the works of Shakespeare) and then the program
will go on spitting out vaguely similar-sounding output ad infinitum. It can
be quite entertaining.
