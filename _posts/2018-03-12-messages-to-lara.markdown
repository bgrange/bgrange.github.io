You should never have to work at McDonald's  
You're a flower that ought to bloom  
And I am just a silly man  
Searching the universe for something to love

The heat dissipation theory of life:  
The sun applies heat and energy to matter on Earth.  
Matter has organized itself into life to process and expel that energy as efficiently as possible. (If it doesn't then it will overheat and break down.)  

For example:  
When a singer sings a song, he is giving off heat through the airwaves of his voice.  
When a philosopher puts an idea into 10,000 people's brains,  
she is giving off heat (if an idea can carry heat somehow?---this I don't fully understand). 
When a man makes love to a woman, he is putting heat into her.  
She may multiply that into a much larger quantity of heat, in the form of a new organism!  

Different people give off heat through different organs. Some prefer the brain,  
others the heart, others the genitals.  Others fail to to give off their heat, and it burns them up from the inside.

Steve Jobs,  
The sad thing is that in communicating your vision to the world,  
You reduced your love of Tina Redse to a consumer product.  
Is that the saddest thing or the greatest thing a man can do?

We don't really have much to talk about. Maybe that's because of language barrier, or because we come from different places  
Or maybe there is a chemistry deeper than words, so that words are superfluous. That is what I felt. An ancient, primordial connection
