title: "Diabetes, Reading, and Quantum Gravity"
---

One of my greatest fears is of diabetes. Last night, I ate a box full of cookies and felt my
fingers and toes tingling and burning afterwards. Neuropathy. Does that mean I have diabetes?
I have a history of hypochondria. But it's not hypochondria. It's reality.

I also have cancer on my arm. Maybe I'll post a photo of it here, if you don't believe me.
It's pretty small, and you'd probably dismiss it as nothing if you saw it. But it's there and real.

It's really no surprise that I have skin cancer. I have red hair. For whatever reason,
redheads are at an increased risk of getting skin cancer. We have less photoprotective melanin in
our skin, I guess. I don't really identify as a redhead. I would say my hair is fifty percent
between red and brown. It's auburn, really.

Perhaps in defiance of nature, and heeding the wisdom of internet health blogs, I got a lot of
sun exposure in my late teens and early twenties. I took a long trip to Central and South America,
where I worked outside on farms and surfed at the beach. The sun there was absolutely brutal.
That was probably when the mutation that created this cancer originated. I think I could even
pinpoint the moment, walking down the sandy road, going to the school where I was studying Spanish.

I was conscious of the need for sunscreen, and was equipped with a carefully selected product without
any toxic chemicals. But I really hate the stuff, and didn't apply it consistently except on my face.
In fact, I have often sought out sun exposure, as many people do, thinking it healthy. Living a
sedentary lifestyle, indoor all day long, can't be good for you. The sun does, in fact, have
health-promoting effects. At home, I would lie out on the backyard lawn, shirtless, getting as many
rays as I could. I saw my pasty white thighs and thought I should have a more uniform tan. I'm ashamed
to say it, but to an outside observer, I'm no better than the basic bitches and guidos who tan at the beach
or in tanning salons. I may believe myself to have more elevated motives of health, but the observable
behavior is the same.

Dr. Mercola and other health blogs trumpeted the importance of getting enough sun. One reason is the
Vitamin D, but there were also studies showing sunlight to have effects on wound-healing (if memory serves),
brain function, among other things. I remember, there was even one source promoting the practice of
staring at the sun--through squinted eyes, thank god--in the early morning.

The plethora of information on the internet has been exalted all too often, but I won't hesitate to add
my voice to the chorus. I still don't know what's true.

Turns out, melearns the other day, redheads can produce their own Vitamin D. So at least one of the reasons
for exposing myself to high doses of solar radiation was moot.

I really should have moved to Ireland. Living there, I might still have perfect, cancer-free skin. 
Instead, I moved to Volgograd, where the summer sun, thoough considerably more bearable than in Costa Rica,
is strong. It's stronger than in New York where I grew up.

I want to transitin from the self-indulgent topic of my health problems to an equally self-indulgent, but
hopefully somewhat more hopeful topic: reading. I have a lot of difficulty reading. Not in the sense
that I am cognitively unable to do it, but at a more psychological level, I hate it. It gives me no
pleasure. Reading usually feels like someone is stabbing me in the eyes.

Another problem I have is math. I used to love math. I still do. But I am not actively engaged in it
anymore. I suffered from burnout in college. I was intimidated by all the math super-geniuses I was
surrounded by, and lost my mathematical mojo.

It might be a kind of performance anxiety. I conceptualize math as a competition.
I put a lot of pressure on myself to get the right answer or understand things
right away.

When I read, I vocalize everything in my head. Is that really necessary? Though words are auditory objects,
the concepts they represent are more important. For math and reading to become creative, exploratory,
and pleasurable again will take nothing less than a complete reorganization of my brain.

Periodically, I make small steps: writing a little program which allows  me to step
through a text word by word; doing sentence unscrambling exercises like you do when you are learning a foreign
language. Indeed, every day, or every other day, there is some breakthrough. In another sense, though,  progress has been slow.
I still live in a mental fog, unable to study number theory, physics, or linguistics, not to mention history, politics,
and literature, with the ferocious energy that lies trapped within me.

But today, I made a true breakthrough. But before I reveal what I did, I want to mention (and pay homage to) Randy Pausch.
I had never heard of Randy Pausch until recently, when I saw a video of his last lecture on YouTube. He died of
cancer. (When?) He was a professor computer science at Carnegie-Mellon, and a pioneer in VR.

In his lecture, he makes the point that in order to learn something, it is often best to disguise it as something else.
To teach girls to program, cloak it as a storytelling activity. I have often had the same thought, and it seems
to be a fundamental feature of how the mind works.

So, what was my reading breakthrough today? I took an article from the New Yorker and I encoded it. 'A' maps to 1,
'B' to 2, 'C' to 3 and so on. Then, instead of reading the text in English, I will read the numerically encoded version.
I'm really kicking myself that I didn't try this sooner. I've been thinking about this alphabetic code and the power
of the alphabet for two years. Even longer ago than that, in Prague, I discovered a book on number theory in which
exactly such a code is employed (base 26). I routinely point out that there's no essential difference between a
sequence of numerical symbols and alphabetic ones. And I live in a haze of infatuation with Godel's theorems, which
were proved by coding logical expressions as numbers. I had all these ideas, but I never made the connection to reading,
never thought that here might lie the solution to my reading problem.

In this encoding, 'the' becomes 2085, 'official' is 1566939112 and 'pressure' is 16185191921185. As you can see,
it doesn't exactly make for easy reading. So how could such a strategy improve one's reading ability? When you are a kid,
reading is a bit like code-breaking. But when you have learned the code, it becomes boring. By encoding words
as meaningless strings of numerical digits, you return to the realm of codebreaking. Reading is once again
an active mental process, not just a passive absorbing of words qua audio.

This technique has the advantage of killing two birds with one stone. Not only am I reading an article in the New Yorker,
(it was about an official in Washington who has some sort of panic attack or collapse going home from work. It might be
something called the Havana Syndrome. I haven't finished it yet, understandably, since reading this way is so damn
slow) but I am also getting better acquinted with my "number friends" as one young boy I know calls them.

What about quantum gravity? I actually have no clue about that, except on an extremely superficial level. Maybe someday
I'll tackle the hairy complexity of mathematical physics.

Last night, binging on cookies as I already mentioned, and tea, I also binged on Youtube. I watched a bunch of stuff,
including videos from the Quantum Gravity Research Institute, an interview with cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman,
and a documentary about DeepMind's AlphaGo.

Each of these videos struck me in a different way. When I saw the quantum gravity video, titled something like, "is reality code?"
at first I thought it was not real. I thought it was a short film, fictional. I didn't think this institute was real.
It was like some futuristic ad from a dystopian TV show like Black Mirror. And it was so hilariously DUMB. Even the
look and feel of the camera indicated this. Most serious research institutes don't have ads anyway. They get funding
from the NSF and others.

I still don't know what to think about it. In addition to a short film from the group, I also watched an extended
rant by the director of the place, in which he just talks and talks and talks about all these ideas: consciousness,
crystals, and E8. Actually, the only thing that piques my interest about it is E8. I remember reading an article in the
New York Times, I must have been 16, about a surfer dude who had this theory of everything. And there was a picture
of this lattice in the shape of a circle. It's a Lie group, and I think "this is it. This is why I've been studying
group theory!" (Learning about Lie groups proved not so easy; the resources on the web are rather dry and technical;
Lie groups from dummies, anyone?)

But there was something about the flashy, gaudy disgustingness of the "short film" for quantum gravity research
that seemed true. Like, true in its absolute absurdity. Is that a kind of truth? What if mathematics and physics
are one discipline? Would that imply that consciousness and mind--the stuff of mathematics--is physical?

Donald Hoffman has this idea that our perceptions are not representative of reality. I won't go into depth here
except to say that I like the guy.

The AlphaGo documentary was really fun for me to watch. I felt so deeply for Lee Sedol, Korean Go Champion.
It made me think more about my own AI-making dreams. It also gave me the idea to get Go, and then Chess,
on my phone, and, lacking an opponent, to play against myself. Actually, this is the best way to practice!

Coming back to Hoffman, I just want to add: he believes that consciousness is the primitive basis of reality,
an idea I have always sympathized with. The only problem with it is it might imply solipsism. (Does it?)
This is an interesting thing to think about: to think of mathematical structures as structures in consciousness:
bending, folding. What can you do, how can consciousness be transformed? You start with bare existence consciousness--
pure awareness--"I am"--but how do you get beyond that? To have any kind of mathematics, you need to be able to
divide it in two.
